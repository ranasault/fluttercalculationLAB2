# flutter_calculation
In this project My classmate Roban helped me in main.dart file
i also made changes with the help of AI in some files
A new Flutter project.

In this assignment, i have design and develop a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator  have a user-friendly interface that mimics a real-world calculator and should maintain the last used value even after the application is restarted.
Key Requirements:
User Interface (UI):

The calculator should have a display screen that can show up to 8 digits.
The display should also show error messages such as ERROR (invalid operations) and OVERFLOW (when numbers exceed 8 digits).
Buttons should be arranged in a grid layout similar to a real calculator.
Operations: A fourth column for:
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
/ (Division)
* (Multiplication)
* The last computed value should be stored and retained even if the app is restarted.
